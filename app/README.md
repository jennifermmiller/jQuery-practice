jQuery Practice
======

This is a junk repo that contains two homework assignments and some class notes. 

First assignment: contained in main.js, create 30 different jquery methods. This is my first experience using jQuery.

Second assignment: contained in other.js, create 3 different javascript objects. All need to have methods, one needs to have a method that can mutate another object.
